# Greenhouse-Monitor
 Built a mini greenhouse and I want a system to monitor the temperature, humidity, and soil moisture levels. This is very much still a work in progress and this will be updated as I go along.

## Temperature + Humidity

I'm using a BME280 to measure the temperature and humidity, it's my go to sensor for this sort of stuff. The specific one I'm using here has a Stemma QT connection so I don't need to solder it, which is nice. 

### Steps:

This part is pretty straight forward really:
- Just connect the sensor to the Feather S2 using the Stemma QT port.
- I'm using the 'adafruit_bme280' library and to take readings in CircuitPython:

 '''python
from adafruit_bme280 import basic as adafruit_bme280

i2c = board.I2C()  # uses board.SCL and board.SDA
bme280 = adafruit_bme280.Adafruit_BME280_I2C(i2c)

print("\nTemperature: %0.1f C" % bme280.temperature)
print("Humidity: %0.1f %%" % bme280.humidity)
print("Pressure: %0.1f hPa" % bme280.pressure)
 '''
